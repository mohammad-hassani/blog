#### If you want to create a personal website for yourself and explain what you do. This article is for you ;)

First of all, you must have a [Github](https://github.com) account.

Then create a repository whose name is exactly the same as your username + '.github.io'

For example my account name is [mohammad-hassani](https://github.com/mohammad-hassani) so the repository name will be 'mohammad-hassani.github.io'.

It's optional that you make Readme.md file or not.

After that GitHub will make a website exactly the same as your repository name and you can see your personal web page in browser!

## But it's still empty!

If you created the Readme.md file; that will be show in browser and if not; it's a blank page!

Now clone the repository and make an Index.html file in the folder; if you know the basics of html, CSS and JavaScript; then create a beautiful web page and write your personal info ;) 

Then push the repository and wait a few seconds until GitHub accept your changes.

Then if you open browser and open your web page you will see your changes!

If you want to link a domain to your web page then create a 'CNAME' file in your repository and write your domain in that ; then link domain to GitHub

## If you want help this is an example of my web page:
GitHub repository : [github.com/mohammad-hassani/mohammad-hassani.github.io](https://github.com/mohammad-hassani/mohammad-hassani.github.io)
And my domain: [hasani.id.ir](hasani.id.ir)

Be happy :)
