Hey, this is Mohammad Hassani :smiley:

if you are developing with Linux and wanna import database to docker with terminal you can use this tutorial...

###It's just 4 steps

#1) copy database to _data folder:
first of all you should copy your .sql file to `var/lib/docker/volumes/blog_blogmysql/_data`

in terminal:
```bash
cp DATABASE.sql var/lib/docker/volumes/blog_blogmysql/_data
```
// Replace DATABASE to your database file name

#2) execute docker
now your database is ready to import, in this step execute docker in terminal,
(docker desktop is not supported in Linux but you can install [dockstation](https://dockstation.io/) for Linux, they are similar. and then you can execute there)

also in terminal:
```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINERNAME bash
```
// Replace CONTAINERNAME to your container name like `site_mysql_1`

#3) Bring up mysql
now open mysql in terminal:
```bash
mysql -uroot -p DATABASENAME
```

- if you dont have database in container you can use
```bash
mysql -uroot -p
```
and then:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE DATABASENAME;
```
// Replace DATABASENAME to your database name

#4) source .sql file
ok! everything is set now and ready to go...
in terminal:
```bash
source var/lib/mysql/DATABASE.sql
```
it maybe take some time depends on your .sql file size and your computer.

## better way
- you can use this code instead of step 3 and 4:
```bash
mysql --init-command="set autocommit=0" DATABASENAME < var/lib/mysql/DATABASE.sql
``` 
that's it!

_if you have another way, leave a message :)_

Be happy! ;)
