Hi there!
I wanna talk about git power supplement that named git flow!

git-flow are a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model.
in this post I wanna shows the basic usage and effect of git-flow operations

# Setup 
 important! before using git flow you need a working git installation

#### Setup in mac OS
```bash
$ brew install git-flow-avh
```
#### Setup in macports
```bash
$ port install git-flow-avh
```
#### Setup in linux
```bash
$ apt-get install git-flow
```
#### Setup in windows
```bash
$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install stable | bash
```
# Getting started
Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup.
#### Initialize
Start using git-flow by initializing it inside an existing git repository:
```bash
git flow init
```
You'll have to answer a few questions regarding the naming conventions for your branches.
It's recommended to use the default values.

# Features
@@Develop new features for upcoming releases@@
@@Typically exist in developers repos only@@
#### Start a new feature
Development of new features starting from the 'develop' branch.
Start developing a new feature with
```bash
git flow feature start MYFEATURE
```
This action creates a new feature branch based on 'develop' and switches to it

#### Finish up a feature
Finish the development of a feature. This action performs the following;
   1. *Merges MYFEATURE into 'develop'*
   2. *Removes the feature branch*
   3. *Switches back to 'develop' branch*
```bash
git flow feature finish MYFEATURE
```

#### Publish a feature
Are you developing a feature in collaboration?
Publish a feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users.
```bash
git flow feature publish MYFEATURE
```

#### Getting a published feature
Get a feature published by another user.
```bash
git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE
```
You can track a feature on origin by using
```bash
git flow feature track MYFEATURE
```

# Make a release
1.Support preparation of a new production release
2.Allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release
#### Start a release
To start a release, use the git flow release command. It creates a release branch created from the 'develop' branch.
```bash
git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]
```
You can optionally supply a `[BASE]` commit sha-1 hash to start the release from. The commit must be on the 'develop' branch.

It's wise to publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers. Do it similar to feature publishing with the command:
```bash
git flow release publish RELEASE
```
(You can track a remote release with the
`git flow release track RELEASE` command)
#### Finish up a release
Finishing a release is one of the big steps in git branching. It performs several actions:
1.Merges the release branch back into 'master'
2.Tags the release with its name
3.Back-merges the release into 'develop'
4.Removes the release branch
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qunuvp924l138mdtc6i2.png)
```bash
git flow release finish RELEASE
```
Don't forget to push your tags with `git push origin --tags`
# Hotfixes
1.Hotfixes arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version
2.May be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.
#### git flow hotfix start
Like the other git flow commands, a hotfix is started with
```bash
git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]
```
The version argument hereby marks the new hotfix release name. Optionally you can specify a basename to start from.

#### Finish a hotfix
By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally, the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version.
```bash
git flow hotfix finish VERSION
```
